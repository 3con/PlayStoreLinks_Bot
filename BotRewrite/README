I am now rewriting the bot, to make the code better and easier to understand.


This is because while developing this bot I learnt much about python and I know that the current code is not representing my current skills.


In the new version you will probably see usage of SQLite DBs and a better use of classes. You will also see an overall better code. (That's what I hope!) 


I also included some kind of test, to see if everything is ok. Right now the test if only for a PlayStore search, but in the future I will add more if needed.


What NEEDS to be done ASAP:
*   The database part, to save all the apps already linked to avoid useless searches on the PlayStore
*   The category thing, to link to a category of apps

What might be done in the futute:
*   Display if an app has IAP
